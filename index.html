  </div>
  <div class="article_meta">
    <p>16 February 2025</p>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>For the last few years I've been running the lightning talk track at
<a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>.</p>
<p>This track contains a series of 15 minute talks separated by 5 minute breaks
all day, a format which has been mostly unchanged since its first <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/tracks/lightningtalks.html">introduction in
2007</a>, 18
years ago:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/tracks/lightningtalks.html">
<img alt="Screenshot of FOSDEM 2007 lightning talk schedule" src="./images/2007-lightning-talks.png" />
</a>
<p>There are some advantages to this format:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>listing each talk in the schedule allows people to attend a single talk which interests them, then leave</li>
<li>5 minute gaps between talks allow for more tolerance towards technical difficulties</li>
<li>can be handled like any other talk in the program</li>
</ul>
<p>And some (subjective) disadvantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>different from what people would expect &quot;lightning talks&quot; to mean compared to other events</li>
<li>15 minutes is actually quite a long time, and preparing a good talk of this length requires some effort</li>
<li>more effort makes it harder to spontaneously prepare a talk, and riskier to accept a hastily prepared talk into the schedule</li>
<li>some speakers prepare a talk which takes less than 15 minutes, so someone watching a series of talks might see 10 minutes of talk, followed by 10 minutes of gap before the next talk</li>
</ul>
<p>For better or for worse, the average talk length at FOSDEM has also been steadily decreasing over the years.
If we extrapolate this trend into the future, talks in the current lightning
talk track will at some point be longer than the average talk elsewhere!</p>
<object data="./images/fosdem-talk-length.svg" type="image/svg+xml">Plot of year and average talk length</object>
<p>This clearly makes the case for something which contains even more lightning
than the usual lightning talks.</p>
<p>For FOSDEM 2025, I wanted to make something with the following goals:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A single session with no downtime</li>
<li>Felt spontaneous</li>
<li>Entertaining to watch</li>
<li>Low bar for entry</li>
</ol>
<p>Normally this kind of session at a conference would just be called &quot;lightning
talks&quot;, but we already have the existing lightning talks track which wouldn't
be changing this year.</p>
<p>Since the main difference between them is the quantity of lightning involved, I named it
Lightning Lightning Talks instead.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-software">
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>To run this session, something needed to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Let people submit talk proposals with slides attached</li>
<li>Review and accept some talks</li>
<li>On the day of the session, grab the slides for accepted talks</li>
<li>Display a title screen to make sure the right speaker starts speaking</li>
<li>Display presentation slides</li>
<li>Count how long a speaker has left</li>
<li>Move to the next talk once time has run out</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two points are covered by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pretalx/pretalx">pretalx</a>, the tool used for all the normal
proposal management at FOSDEM. The only complication was making it easy to get
the list of accepted talks and the attached slides. This ended up being a new track in
pretalx, and also a new proposal type to make filtering using the pretalx API
possible.</p>
<p>A tool could then be written to query the API for the data about talks and
write an intermediate config file describing the required info for the upcoming
session. Since there's a much higher chance of changes at the last minute (for
example some speakers not turning up), keeping the info for the session in a
format which could be quickly edited by hand was important. It also removes a
hard dependency on our pretalx deployment, so the session can run even if
pretalx is down for some reason.</p>
<p>This file is a fairly unexciting <tt class="docutils literal">.json</tt> file, and looks about the same as you would expect:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>I wrote a custom presentation tool which reads this <tt class="docutils literal">.json</tt> and uses it to
display a neat title screen for each talk followed by the slides provided by
each speaker. This uses GTK for the main application and Pango + Cairo to
render most of the graphics.</p>
<p>To annoy everyone equally (except LaTeX users) I required slides in <tt class="docutils literal">.pdf</tt>
format, which meant I needed to render pages from them for the main
presentation content. For this I used Poppler <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>, which ended up being pretty
easy to implement (except for spending a bit too long figuring out why a
particular presentation wasn't rendering correctly before I found out pdf
documents could be transparent and I was rendering on a black background).</p>
<p>Most of the time developing this tool probably went into making the title
screen look nice, with a pleasing ease in function (quint, <span class="formula">1 − (1 − <i>t</i>)<sup>5</sup></span>)
animating the FOSDEM cog pulling the title on to the screen:</p>
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="./images/lightninglightning-2025-02-09_15.09.38_1.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video><p>A second window shows the time remaining for the current speaker, which can be displayed on a secondary monitor:</p>
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="./images/lightninglightning-countdown-2025-02-09_15.12.14_1.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video><p>To make sure speakers don't overstay their welcome on the stage, the system
needs to move them on. For lightning talks elsewhere, this is often done with a
separate timer and social pressure to stop. Since this custom presentation tool
knows how long the current speaker has taken and the order of talks, it can
immediately start the next talk once the time has run out.</p>
<p>When the time left reaches 10 seconds, the countdown screen starts flashing in
warning, while the presentation slides slowly fade out to the title screen and
the next talk begins automatically:</p>
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="./images/lightninglightning-countdown-move-to-next-2025-02-09_15.23.33_1.webm" type="video/webm" />

<h2>People logistics</h2>
<p>Despite planning the actual presentation display and submission system, I
hadn't fully planned the logistics of people moving around until the evening
before the session. This meant quickly working out a system to make sure
speakers could smoothly flow from one talk to the next.</p>
<p>With the help of some volunteers who were assisting with running the session on
the day, we thought through a few options and settled with:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Printing off the talk schedule, and giving a copy to each speaker just in case the order is forgotten</li>
<li>Sitting speakers <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n-3</span></tt> in a row of audience seats in the same order as their position in the talk schedule</li>
<li>Using two seats at the side of the stage as a staging area (#1 containing the next speaker, and #2 containing the speaker after next)</li>
<li>Using two handheld microphones (one held by the current speaker, one held by the next speaker)</li>
</ul>
<p>On a talk ending, everybody swaps to a new position simultaneously:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Speaker leaves the stage, handing their microphone to the person in staging area seat #2</li>
<li>Person in the #1 staging area seat takes to the stage and begins their talk</li>
<li>Person in staging area seat #2 moves to seat #1</li>
<li>Person in the rightmost seat in the audience row moves to staging area seat #2</li>
<li>All other speakers sitting in the audience row move one seat to the right</li>
</ol>
<p>This ended up worked pretty smoothly. There was a contingency plan in case a
speaker carried on talking after their time ran out involving a volunteer
threateningly wielding a brush and sweeping them off the stage, which (somewhat
unfortunately, since it would have been entertaining) never needed to be deployed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-it-went">
<h2>How it went</h2>
<p>I was really pleased with how this worked out in the end. Running a session
which relied on custom presentation software and a large number of speakers had
the potential for some unforeseen disaster, which had made me a bit anxious. No
disasters took place, and feedback has been nice.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>
<p>I'd like to make some changes if we run something similar next time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I'd like to encourage more random and fun topics</li>
<li>5 minutes is still quite a long time! In a 50 minute session we can only fit
10 talks if everyone takes the maximum time. Maybe next time the limit could
be 3 minutes.</li>
<li>A bigger display showing the countdown visible from the audience would be nice</li>
<li>Make sure no mouse cursor is drawn over slides</li>
<li>The countdown should start as soon as the title screen is shown</li>
<li>A remote control to skip to the next presentation would be good, some
speakers forgot to complete their slides all the way to the end, so the next
speaker needed to skip forward a bit awkwardly</li>
<li>Shuffling all speakers one seat over was necessary because all the seats in
this room have built in desks which make getting in and out of a row awkward
unless you are sitting right at the end. Obtaining extra chairs to make an
additional row of seats at the font would avoid needing to do this.</li>
<li>The submission process needs to be smoother. The extra track and submission
type was confusing in the pretalx UI.</li>
<li>The submission deadline and status needs to be communicated better. I was
originally worried about not getting enough proposals, but ended up getting
too many. I closed submissions early since I didn't want people to spend time
working on a presentation if all the spaces were taken, but this (quite
rightfully) annoyed some people since they thought there would still be time
to submit a talk</li>
</ul>
<p>I originally wanted to make talk order random out of a pool of people who
registered as speakers before the session begins. However this felt a bit too
risky for a first try. Perhaps some element of this could be introduced next
time?</p>
<p>Hopefully Lightning Lightning Talks will return next time (maybe with a name change)!</p>

  </div>
  <div class="article_meta">
    <p>22 January 2016</p>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>For abersailbot, I've been working on automation of provisioning images to run
on the main raspberry pi inside the boat. In the past, this has been a
primitive bash script which installs packages and configurations files with a
dubious amount of calls out to apt, cp and sed. Wanting to make this a little
more sophisticated, I started writing a set of ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>For testing other repositories, I normally always use
<a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org">https://travis-ci.org</a>. If you're not familiar, Travis CI offers free CI
resources for open source repositories. The VMs it boots are all Ubuntu on
x86_64, however. In order to test things on raspbian, some hacks would be
needed.</p>
<p>Options I considered:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>No testing (no tests? What madness!)</li>
<li>ARM chroot</li>
<li>Raspbian fat Docker container</li>
<li>Raspbian image booted under QEMU</li>
</ol>
<p>After some playing around, the QEMU route seemed like the best option. If you'd
like to do the same, the steps I took are fairly simple:</p>
<p>First off, we need to get a disk image. The images provided from the Raspberry
Pi site need some small modifications to run under QEMU, so we need to mount
and edit it. I'm using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2015-11-21-raspbian-jessie-lite.img</span></tt> image from
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/</a>.</p>
<p>This image contains two partitions, a small boot partition (FAT) which contains
a few config files and a kernel, and the main ext4 root partition. The latter
is the partition we're interested in. You can inspect the image with <tt class="docutils literal">fdisk</tt>
to show these:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

</pre>
<p>Note the start of the partition we're interested in (131072). This is the
offset from the start of the image in terms of number of sectors. The sector
size is 512, so the actual offset in terms of bytes is 131072 × 512 =
67108864.</p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, we can mount the image and edit files on it
interactively.</p>
<p>First, create a directory to mount the image:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ mkdir raspbian-jessie-mount-point
</pre>
<p>then mount the image:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo mount -o loop,offset=67108864 2015-11-21-raspbian-jessie-lite.img \
  raspbian-jessie-mount-point
</pre>
<p>Now it's time to comment out a bunch of things.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">raspbian-jessie-mount-point/etc/ld.so.preload</span></tt> in an editor of your
choice and comment out all lines.</li>
<li>Do the same and comment out all lines related to <tt class="docutils literal">mmccblk</tt> in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">raspbian-jessie-mount-point/etc/fstab</span></tt></li>
</ol>
<p>After these edits have been made, unmount the image:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo umount raspbian-jessie-mount-point
</pre>
<p>The modified image can now be saved and backed up somewhere. I took a copy and
compressed it to save on space:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ xz 2015-11-21-raspbian-jessie-lite.img
</pre>
<p>Now we have an image to boot, we need a kernel to run. Sadly, a modified
kernel is required, since QEMU does not support raspberry pi hardware. Luckily
the work of patching and building has already been done by someone else.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/polaco1782/raspberry-qemu">https://github.com/polaco1782/raspberry-qemu</a> appears to work well.</p>
<p>Clone that repository and copy <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kernel-qemu</span></tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ git clone git&#64;github.com:polaco1782/raspberry-qemu.git
$ cp raspberry-qemu/kernel-qemu .
</pre>
<p>At this point, booting should be possible. To test, first install
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu-system-arm</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If you're on Fedora:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo dnf install qemu-system-arm
</pre>
<p>Or Debian/Ubuntu:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo apt install qemu-system-arm
</pre>
<p>Then run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ qemu-system-arm \
    -kernel kernel-qemu \
    -cpu arm1176 \
    -m 256 \
    -M versatilepb \
    -no-reboot \
    -serial stdio \
    -display none \
    -append &quot;root=/dev/sda2 panic=1 rootfstype=ext4 rw&quot; \
    -net user,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22 \
    -net nic -hda \
    2015-11-21-raspbian-jessie-lite.img
</pre>
<p>Note the option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-net</span> <span class="pre">user,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22</span></tt>. This forwards port 22 on
raspbian to 10022 on the host, allowing us to ssh into the booted VM.</p>
<p>You should see some output similar to:</p>

<p>Test if a login works:</p>

<p>If this all works, you can start writing your <tt class="docutils literal">.travis.yml</tt> to boot this VM

<p>You should note this requires a mirror of the image created in the earlier
steps. Each CI run will have to download and decompress the image. With Travis
Pro, I believe you might be able to do something different and cache it, but I
didn't investigate this.</p>
<p>This runs <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu-system-arm</span></tt> in the background. In order to wait until the VM
is ready, I made a crude script named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wait-for-ssh</span></tt> to ping the ssh port
until it responded:</p>

<p>When this is done, you can actually test the stuff you wanted to test in the
first place! In the example <tt class="docutils literal">.travis.yml</tt>, I do a sanity check and cat
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/os-release</span></tt>, expecting something like:</p>

    <h3><a href="./kpatch-package-builder">kpatch-package-builder 0.1.0</a></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="article_meta">
    <p>29 June 2015</p>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>As part of <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google Summer of Code</a>, I've been working with the
CentOS project to create a delivery and build system to provide easy and
automatic delivery of patches to a running linux kernel. CentOS 7 currently has
support for live patching a running kernel (via the kpatch kernel module and
the surrounding userland tools), but crafting a patch and applying it is a
currently a very manual process. The overall aim of the project is to make
applying kernel fixes an easy and automatic process, which will make it easier
to keep a CentOS installation more secure by without having to schedule
downtime.</p>
<p>As the first part of this project, I've been writing
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kpatch-package-builder</span></tt>, a tool which generates RPM packages containing a
kernel module which patchs the currently running kernel.  These distributable
packages contain a single kernel patch, so standard package management tools,
such as dnf and yum can install and manage them.</p>
<p>This first version is pretty simple. You create a patch against the source of the
kernel you want to modify, then run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kpatch-package-builder</span></tt> with the patch
name as the last argument. The output can either be a built .rpm file, or the
raw spec.</p>
<p>By default <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kpatch-package-builder</span></tt> outputs an RPM .spec file, which can be
used to build the RPM. This is a very simple spec, which just specifies the
name of the package, description, and other common package metadata. The name
of the package currently is based off the patch filename with a prefix of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kpatch-module-</span></tt>, which allows these packages to be simply distinguished.
Future versions will have a series of virtual dependencies to prevent patch
collisions, but that's something for a future post.</p>
<p>When given the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-b</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--build-rpm</span></tt> option, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kpatch-package-builder</span></tt>
will invoke rpmbuild and build the package in place. The makes the kernel patch
to distributable package a single step.</p>
<p>As an example, creating a package from a patch file:</p>

<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>Next up is the rest of the tooling to make building and distributing a series
of patches across a set of kernel versions easy. This will be working on top of
the basic kpatch-package-builder functionality to allow building many versions
of packages for particular kernels.</p>

    <p>Vagrant is <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1020456">now packaged</a> in Fedora 21 and later versions, which is great news.
No more messing around with the horror of rvm!</p>
<p>After installing vagrant and the libvirt plugin with yum:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo yum install vagrant vagrant-libvirt
</pre>
<p>I got some syntax errors from Vagrant:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ vagrant up
/usr/share/vagrant/lib/vagrant/pre-rubygems.rb:19:in `require_relative': /usr/share/vagrant/lib/vagrant/bundler.rb:217: syntax error, unexpected tPOW (SyntaxError)
    def internal_install(plugins, update, **extra)
                                            ^
/usr/share/vagrant/lib/vagrant/bundler.rb:298: class definition in method body
/usr/share/vagrant/lib/vagrant/bundler.rb:315: class definition in method body
/usr/share/vagrant/lib/vagrant/bundler.rb:368: syntax error, unexpected keyword_end, expecting $end
    from /usr/share/vagrant/lib/vagrant/pre-rubygems.rb:19:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</pre>
<p>This was caused by rvm having an old version of ruby installed, which is what
was installed when I installed vagrant on this machine initially:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ruby --version
ruby 1.9.3p545 (2014-02-24 revision 45159) [x86_64-linux]
</pre>
<p>Luckily you can just:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ rvm implode
</pre>
<p>and everything will be happy, where happy is defined by vagrant running and
having the fewest versions of ruby installed.</p>
